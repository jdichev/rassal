# Japanese Kamon – The Art of Family Crests
**Origins and History**

Japanese *Kamon* (家紋) are sophisticated symbols representing lineage, history, and the natural world.

* **Heian Period (794–1185):** Originally used by aristocrats to identify their ox carriages and silk robes in the imperial court.
* **Kamakura Period (1185–1333):** Adopted by the Samurai class. Crests became vital on the battlefield to distinguish friend from foe on banners (*nobori*) and armor.
* **Edo Period (1603–1867):** Usage spread to commoners (merchants and artisans), evolving into a standardized heraldic system used for formal wear.

# Design Philosophy
**Minimalism and Geometry**

Kamon are celebrated globally for their "less is more" aesthetic.

* **Circular Framing:** Most designs are contained within a circle (*maru*), representing harmony and the infinite.
* **Abstraction:** Complex subjects (like birds or flowers) are distilled into bold, monochromatic shapes for maximum legibility.
* **Mathematical Precision:** Designs often rely on compass-and-ruler geometry, utilizing rotational or reflective symmetry.
